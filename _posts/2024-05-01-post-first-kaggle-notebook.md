Earlier this week, I checked out an open-source Kaggle dataset and examined the relationship between physical activity and quality of sleep. My goals were to apply what I learnt from my statistics class at University to a project and to get familiar with data science.

There's already papers out there that better examine this relationship (such as <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37095143/" target="blank">this journal article</a>). In any case, it was sitll a fun project.

See the whole notebook <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/code/giulianoverdone/up-to-date-sleep-health-and-lifestyle-analysis" target="blank">at the link here</a>. If you're just interested in the dataset, <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imaginativecoder/sleep-health-data-sampled" target="blank">you can find that here</a>. Also, thanks to <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/machine-learning-project-heart-attack-prediction-analysis/" target="blank">this Udemy course</a> by Oak Academy, I pretty much knew how to structure the contents.

## Learning Outcomes

The Kaggle notebook that I ended up making was super basic; no machine learning was involved since none of the data that I was working with followed a normal distribution. However, I did get to observe a weak, positive correlation between Physical Acitivity Level and Sleep Duration. There was also a slightly stronger, positive correlation between Physical Activity Level and Quality of Sleep. The correlations suggest that higher levels of physical activity could be associated with better sleep, but other factors definitely contribute to one's sleep as well.
