# Contact

Send me a message at g_verdon@live.concorida.ca. You can also get in touch with me through GitHub or LinkedIn.

# Background and Education

I was born and raised in Canada, and right now I'm studying at Concordia University. Before that, I was in Computer Science and Mathematics at Vanier College. I'd like to do a lot more once I graduate with my bachelor's degree in software engineering.

# Hobbies

Fitness and engineering projects are the hobbies that I really enjoy outside of school. Video games every once in a while are cool too.
